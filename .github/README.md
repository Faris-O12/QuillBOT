- If you find a bug/issue you can use the `"bug_report.md" (.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)` as a template for your issue
- If you have a feature/command that you think might be awesome to add, you can use the `"feature_request.md" (.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md)` file as a template
